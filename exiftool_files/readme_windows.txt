This ExifTool package is intended to avoid problems of the PAR packed original ExifTool for Windows. 

It consists of:

* ExifTool by Phil Harvey https://exiftool.org/ resp. https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool
* Strawberry Perl http://strawberryperl.com/
* My tiny launcher https://oliverbetz.de/pages/Artikel/ExifTool-for-Windows

Please note that there can be up to three exiftool scripts in the "exiftool_files" directory:
* exiftool.pl - only this one is called by the launcher
* exiftool - this is from the original ExifTool distribution
* windows_exiftool - this is from the original ExifTool distribution

I make no warranties about the package, and disclaim liability for all uses of the package, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

Please send useful comments to mailto:ppl@oliverbetz.de - especially if you found bugs or improved something.
